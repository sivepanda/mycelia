# Contributing to `autodetect.json`
`Autodetect.json` is a list of package managers/libraries that often require some sort of syncing after a pull or checkout. This list is used to suggest potential post- pull and checkout commands, however, it is always the user's choice on whether or not they use them. Users can also add their own custom commands to their config file, so additions to autodetect must be general and widely used libraries.

Feel free to make a pull request!

## Keys
`name` The name of the package manager/library  
`detectFile` File that when detected, can be used to infer a potential package manager/library used  
`detectFiles` Files that only when detected *together*, can be used to infer a potential package manager/library used **CANNOT BE USED WITH detectFile**  
`description` Description of the command/library/pkgman  
`commands` contains post-pull and post-checkout commands. **Both post-pull and post-checkout use the same schema.**  
`post-pull` contains associated post-pull command  
`post-checkout` contains associated post-checkout command  
`command` bash command to run  
`workingDir` directory to run bash command  
`description` description of bash command  

## Examples
Below is a simple example of an addition to autodetect:
```json
{
    "name": "npm",
    "detectFile": "package.json",
    "description": "Node.js (npm)",
    "commands": {
      "post-pull": [
        {
          "command": "npm install",
          "workingDir": ".",
          "description": "Install npm dependencies"
        }
      ],
      "post-checkout": [
        {
          "command": "npm install",
          "workingDir": ".",
          "description": "Install npm dependencies"
        }
      ]
}
```

Alternatively, if multiple files must be detected to infer, you can add multiple `detectFiles`:
```json
    "name": "prisma-pnpm",
    "detectFiles": [
      "prisma/schema.prisma",
      "pnpm-lock.yaml"
    ],
    "excludes": [
      "prisma-npm"
    ],
    "description": "Prisma ORM (pnpm)",
    "commands": {
      "post-pull": [
        {
          "command": "pnpm prisma generate",
          "workingDir": ".",
          "description": "Generate Prisma Client (pnpm)"
        },
        {
          "command": "pnpm prisma migrate deploy",
          "workingDir": ".",
          "description": "Apply Prisma migrations (pnpm)"
        }
      ],
      "post-checkout": [
        {
          "command": "pnpm prisma generate",
          "workingDir": ".",
          "description": "Generate Prisma Client (pnpm)"
        },
        {
          "command": "pnpm prisma migrate deploy",
          "workingDir": ".",
          "description": "Apply Prisma migrations (pnpm)"
        }
      ]
    }
```
